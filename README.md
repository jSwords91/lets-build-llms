# lets-build-llms
Various LLMs written from scratch, for pedagogical purposes only

I'll include code to load in the pre-trained weights from Huggingface for whatever we implement so we can ensure validity. 

I will endeavour to add a training loop along with a sample dataset too to showcase the training process.
